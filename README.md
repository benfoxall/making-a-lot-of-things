# Making a lot of things
### Slides for FSF 17


There's a satisfaction in creating something.

Taking a concept, chat or sketch and being able to implement something that people can interact with is one of the wonderful things about the area that we work in.

I'll talk about what it means to be creative, it's benefits, and how we can optimise our approaches to building software & projects to make the most of ourselves.

Together, we'll explore how to make things that are able to be used to build something bigger.
